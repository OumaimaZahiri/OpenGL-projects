A C++ application that shows a primitive (a triangle, a square or a polygon) whose coordinates were created
manually on openGL in such way that they are situated in the center of the widget.
- pressing on the C key allows the user to randomly change the colour of the background.
- the O key changes randomly the colours of three groups of the vertices : we can have a 
  non-uniformally coloured primitive as observed below :

- pressing on the space key helps change the primitive as followed (triangle => square => polygon
  => triangle).
- while the R key generates a random rotation of the primitive.
