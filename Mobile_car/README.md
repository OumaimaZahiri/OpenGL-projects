This is also a basic application where a car is shown to be miving onwards on a road. The goal of this project being to get me familirised with evolved openGL notions
such as the types of projection on the scene, the lighting, the textures and other aspects of creation and visualisation of a 3D scene for a project that will be 
uploaded on this git later on.
